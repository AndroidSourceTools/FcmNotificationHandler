FCMNotificationHandler
===============================
Android library to construct and fire system tray notifications from FCM Notification messages when the app is in foreground, mimicking the default format and behavior applied when the app is background.

Usage
-----
Just add the following line in the `onMessageReceived` method of your `FirebaseMessagingService` and a system notification will be shown as if the FCM message were received when the app was in background:
```java
new RemoteMessageNotifier(getApplicationContext()).notify(remoteMessage);
```

You can also just map the FCM Notification to a system notification with:
```java
new RemoteMessageToNotificationMapper(getApplicationContext()).map(remoteMessage);
```
or map it to a notification builder with:
You can also just map the FCM Notification to a system notification with:
```java
new RemoteMessageToNotificationMapper(getApplicationContext()).mapToNotificationBuilder(remoteMessage);
```
Take into account that if your FCM message does not have any notification information (is a Data only message) an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown when calling any of the previous described methods.
